# 👋 Hey there, I’m Chhavi Rathod

Welcome to the part of the internet where I pretend to be more organized than I actually am.

I'm a web developer and full-stack explorer. Currently building projects, fighting semicolons, and occasionally yelling at my code (lovingly).

## 💼 What I Actually Do

- 💻 Build websites that (mostly) work  
- 🧠 Learn things faster than my computer can crash   
- ⚙️ Debug by staring really hard at the screen until it fixes itself

---

## 💡 Currently into:

- 🧬 Full-stack MERN   
- 🤖 AI + ML experiments gone slightly chaotic  
- 📦 Creating projects that are *probably* cooler than your cousin's startup  
- 🧩 DSA (because pain is temporary, but Big O is forever)

## 🎬 Fun Facts

- I talk to my laptop. It hasn't talked back. Yet.
- I can explain recursion. Just ask me to explain recursion.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
